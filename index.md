## About Me

I'm currently working as a postdoc in [Colm Nestor's group](https://liu.se/en/research/epigenetic-control-of-human-t-cell-biology) at Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden.
  
I received my Ph.D. degree from Linköping University, Sweden in 2025. My research focuses on the inactive X-chromosome (Xi), where I've looked at how the Xi is regulated during human T cell development via integrative data analysis of single-cell, bulk allele-specific expression, DNA methylation and sex-biased gene expression. I have also studied variability of escape from X-chromosome inactivation across tissue within the same individual. Recently, my work has shifted towards skewed XCI and its origin, where I primarily work with long read sequencing (nanopore). Currently, I am very interested in adaptive sampling and how it can be modified. I also have a very general interest in genetics, especially anything related to the sex chromosomes. Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my family, running, mountain biking and hiking. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
