## About Me

I'm starting my lab in January 2024 at the [Arc Institute](https://arcinstitute.org/), a new research institute operating in partnership with Stanford University, UCSF, and UC Berkeley.  
  
Before joining Arc, I was a Ph.D. students in [Joseph Eckerâ€™s laboratory](https://ecker.salk.edu) at the Salk Institute and Howard Hughes Medical Institute. I received my B.S. from Tsinghua University and my Ph.D. through the Bioinformatics and Systems Biology program at the University of California, San Diego. My research have focused on exploring the gene regulation landscape of the mammalian brain through integrative analyses of multimodality single-cell data. At Arc, I will continue to develop single-cell high-throughput technologies and computational tools in my own lab, to come up with more diverse types of data and analyses for quantitative modeling of gene expression dynamics.
