## About Me

I am a computational biologist and currently a postdoctoral researcher in [Colm Nestor's research group](https://liu.se/en/research/epigenetic-control-of-human-t-cell-biology). I earned my Ph.D. from Linköping University, Sweden, in Colm Nestor’s lab, where I studied the dynamics of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in humans. My research focused on the fidelity of XCI escape during human T cell development, the variability of escape across tissues within individuals, and the frequency and genetic basis of constitutional XCI skew.
To investigate XCI escape, I employed integrative analyses of both direct measures, including single-cell and bulk allele-specific expression (the latter in females with completely skewed XCI), and indirect measures such as DNA methylation and sex-biased gene expression. For studying constitutional XCI skew, we developed a novel method, Tandem Repeat-based Identification of X-chromosome Inactivation (TRiXi), and but I have also leveraged long-read nanopore sequencing to assess XCI skew via allele-specific methylation.
Currently, I am exploring the research opportunities enabled by nanopore and long-read sequencing, including adaptive sampling strategies tailored to our experimental needs and applications in epitranscriptomics. My broader interests lie in genetics, with a particular focus on the sex chromosomes. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, running, mountain biking, and hiking.
