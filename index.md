## About Me

I'm currently pursuing a PhD in [Colm Nestor's group](https://liu.se/en/research/epigenetic-control-of-human-t-cell-biology) at Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden. I am defending my thesis on the 26th of Septemeber 2025.
  
I received my B.S. in medical laboratory science and my MSc in medical biology at Linköping University, Sweden. My research focuses on the inactive X-chromosome (Xi), where I've looked at how the Xi is regulated during human T cell development via integrative data analysis of single-cell, bulk allele-specific expression, DNA methylation and sex-biased gene expression. I have also studied variability of escape from X-chromosome inactivation across tissue within the same individual. My current work mainly concern skewed XCI and its origin where I primarily work with long read sequencing (nanopore) and scRNA-seq (smart-seq2). I am very interested in broadening my skills in data analysis/bioinfo but also within the field of biology. Outside of my main research area I have a very general interest in genetics, especially anything related to the sex chromosomes. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
