## About Me
  
Currently a postdoc in [Colm Nestor's group](https://liu.se/en/research/epigenetic-control-of-human-t-cell-biology) at Linköping University, Sweden, working mainly with computational biology. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Linköping University, Sweden, in the lab of Colm Nestor, focusing on the dynamics of X-chromosome inactivation in humans. I specifically focuses on the fidelity of XCI escape in human T cell development, the variability of escape from XCI across tissues within the same individual and the frequency, and genetic origin of, constitutional XCI skew. To study escape from XCI I used integrative data analysis of direct measures of escape like single-cell and bulk allele-specific expression (in females with a completely skewed XCI) and indirect measures like DNA methylation and sex-biased gene expression. To study constitutional XCI skew we developed a novel method to accurately assess XCI, Tandem Repeat-based Identification of X-chromosome Inactivation (TRiXi), but also leveraged the strength of long-read nanopore data to assess XCI skew using allele-specific methylation. Currently, I am very interested in the avenues of research that nanopore and long-read sequencing techniques open up. Currently, I am trying to modify adaptive sampling approaches to suit our sequencing needs as well as moving towards epitranscriptomics using nanopore. I also have a very general interest in genetics, especially anything related to the sex chromosomes. Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my family, running, mountain biking and hiking.
