## About Me

I'm a postdoctoral fellow in [Joseph Eckerâ€™s laboratory](https://ecker.salk.edu) at the Salk Institute and Howard Hughes Medical Institute. I'm starting my lab in Januray 2024 at the [Arc Institute](https://arcinstitute.org/), a new research institute operating in partnership with Stanford University, UCSF, and UC Berkeley.  
  
I received my B.S. from Tsinghua University and my Ph.D. through the Bioinformatics and Systems Biology program at the University of California, San Diego. My research have been focused on exploring the gene regulation landscape of the mammalian brain through integrative analysis of multimodality single-cell data. At Arc, I will continue to develop single-cell high-throughput technologies and computational tools in my own lab, to come up with more diverse types of data and analyses for quantitative modeling of gene expression dynamics.

## Research Interests

- **Single Cell Genomics**
- **Sequence to Phenotype**
- **Gene Regulation in Development**

## News

- **[Sep. 2023]** I will join the Arc Institute as a Science Fellow in January 2024!
- **[Sep. 2023]** Our paper about adult human brain atlas is accepted to Science.
