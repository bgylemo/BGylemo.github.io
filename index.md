## About Me

I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Colm Nestors group at Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden.
  
I received my B.S. in medical laboratory science and my MSc in medical biology at Linköping University, Sweden.
My research focuses on exploring how the inactive X-chromosome is regulated during human T cell development through integrative analyses of multimodality data, including single-cell and bulk allele-specific expression, DNA methylation and sex-biased gene expression. Furthemrore, I have studied variability of escape from X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) across tissue within the same individual. My current work mainly concern skewed XCI and its origin.
